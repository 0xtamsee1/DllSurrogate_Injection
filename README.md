# COM-based DLL Surrogate Injection

## Abstract

This proof of concept is an injection technique that leverages the Component Object Model (COM) and DLL Surrogate processes for stealthy code execution. Unlike traditional COM hijacking methods which focuses primarily on persistence, this technique exploits the surrogate hosting capabilities to achieve process injection with several operational advantages, including parent process masquerading and reduced detection footprint.
